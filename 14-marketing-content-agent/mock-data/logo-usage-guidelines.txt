No maximum size, but consider context:

LOGO MISUSE EXAMPLES
=============================================================================

INCORRECT USAGE:

❌ STRETCHED:
[Logo stretched horizontally or vertically]
Problem: Distorts proportions, looks unprofessional
Solution: Always maintain original aspect ratio

❌ WRONG COLORS:
[Logo in non-brand colors like green, purple, orange]
Problem: Off-brand, confusing
Solution: Use official color versions only

❌ ADDED EFFECTS:
[Logo with drop shadow, glow, outline, gradient]
Problem: Cluttered, dated, not on-brand
Solution: Use clean logo files with no effects

❌ POOR CONTRAST:
[Dark logo on dark background, light logo on light background]
Problem: Illegible, doesn't meet accessibility standards
Solution: Use reverse logo for dark backgrounds

❌ BUSY BACKGROUND:
[Logo on complex photo or pattern]
Problem: Logo gets lost, hard to read
Solution: Place on solid background or add background box

❌ TOO SMALL:
[Logo smaller than minimum size, illegible]
Problem: Can't read wordmark
Solution: Use larger size or brand mark only

❌ ROTATED:
[Logo tilted at an angle]
Problem: Looks unprofessional and off-brand
Solution: Always keep logo horizontal

❌ INSIDE SHAPE:
[Logo placed inside circle, square, or other shape]
Problem: Constrains logo, adds visual clutter
Solution: Use logo on its own with clearspace

❌ ALTERED WORDMARK:
[Logo with modified text, different font, or changed spacing]
Problem: Inconsistent branding
Solution: Use official logo files only

❌ MULTIPLE LOGOS:
[Different logo versions used on same page]

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
=============================================================================

Q: Can I change the logo colors to match my design?
A: No. Always use official logo versions. If you need the logo on a
   colored background, choose the appropriate version (color, reverse,
   or monochrome) but never alter the logo colors themselves.

Q: The logo is too small in my design. Can I make the wordmark larger?
A: No. Never alter the proportions. Instead, use a larger overall logo
   size, or use the wordmark-only version if horizontal space is very wide.

Q: Can I put a circle around the brand mark for social media?
A: No. Use the brand mark as-is without additional shapes or containers.
   Social platforms will display it in their frame (circle, square, etc.)
   but don't add extra shapes yourself.

Q: What if the logo doesn't look good on my background?
A: Choose a different logo version (reverse or monochrome), or choose a
   different background. Never alter the logo to "make it work."

Q: Can I animate the logo for video?
A: Simple animations (fade in, slide in) are acceptable. Complex animations
   or effects require brand team approval. Contact brand@company.com.

Q: I found an old version of the logo online. Can I use it?
A: No. Always download the current logo from brand.company.com/logos.
   Old versions are outdated and should not be used.

Q: Do I need permission to use the logo internally?
A: Employees can use official logo files from the brand portal without
   permission for standard applications (slides, docs, etc.). Non-standard
   usage should be reviewed by brand team.

Q: Can partners/vendors use our logo?
A: Only with written permission and following these guidelines. Partners
   must request access to logo files and receive approval for usage.

Q: What if I need a logo size or format not available?
A: Contact brand team (brand@company.com) with your specific needs. They
   can provide custom files if needed.

Q: Can I use the logo in my email signature?
A: Yes. Follow the email signature guidelines in this document. Use PNG
   format, 120-150px wide, linked to website (optional).
