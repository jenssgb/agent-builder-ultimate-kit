Subject: Cloud Services Contract Renewal - Pricing Discussion

Hi Robert,

Our contract with CloudVendor is up for renewal on December 31, 2024. We've been happy with the service overall, but I need to discuss pricing for the renewal term.

CURRENT CONTRACT:
- Annual cost: $240,000
- Services: Cloud infrastructure (IaaS) + Database services
- Compute: 50 VMs (various sizes)
- Storage: 100TB
- Data transfer: Unlimited
- Support level: Business (24/7 phone + 1-hour SLA)
- Contract term: 3 years (expires Dec 31, 2024)

RENEWAL QUOTE RECEIVED:
- Your team quoted $310,000 annual (29% increase)
- Same services and support level
- 3-year term

CONCERNS:
The 29% price increase is difficult to justify to our CFO, especially since our usage has remained relatively flat. We're exploring alternatives including:
- AWS (comparable services at $265,000/year)
- Azure (comparable services at $275,000/year)
- Hybrid approach with multiple vendors

We value our partnership with CloudVendor, but the pricing needs to be competitive. Can we schedule time this week to discuss?

I'm hoping we can find a path to renewal that works for both organizations.

Best regards,
Lisa Park
IT Director

Hi Lisa,

Thanks for your note. I understand your concerns about the pricing. Let me provide context on the increase:

FACTORS DRIVING PRICE ADJUSTMENT:
1. Infrastructure costs have increased 15% industry-wide
2. Enhanced security features added since your contract (zero-trust architecture, advanced threat detection)
3. Performance improvements (40% faster compute, improved network latency)
4. New compliance certifications (SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, HIPAA)

That said, I recognize you're a valued long-term customer (5 years with us). Let me work with my team on a revised proposal.

QUESTIONS TO HELP ME BUILD A BETTER OFFER:
1. Would you consider a longer contract term (5 years) for better pricing?
2. Are there services you're not using that we could remove?
3. Are you interested in Reserved Instances for further savings?
4. What price point makes sense for your budget?

Let's schedule 30 minutes this Thursday (Oct 31) at 2pm to discuss. I'll bring my solutions architect to ensure we're optimizing your environment.

Best,
Robert Chen
Account Executive, CloudVendor

Robert,

Thanks for the quick response. Here are answers to your questions:

1. CONTRACT TERM:
   - We could consider 4 years (not 5 due to budget planning cycles)
   - Need annual price escalation clause to be capped at 3%

2. SERVICE OPTIMIZATION:
   - We're probably over-provisioned on compute (some VMs running at <30% utilization)
   - Could potentially reduce from 50 VMs to 40 with right-sizing
   - Not using your CDN service (bundled in current contract)

3. RESERVED INSTANCES:
   - Yes, interested for our production VMs (approximately 30 VMs)
   - Development/test VMs can remain on-demand

4. TARGET PRICE:
   - Budget constraint: $260,000/year (8% increase from current)
   - Stretch: $275,000/year (14% increase)
   - Your quote: $310,000/year (29% increase) ❌ Not feasible

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- We're planning a cloud migration project in 2025 that would increase usage by ~20%
- If pricing is competitive, we'd route that growth to CloudVendor
- If not, we'll likely move to a multi-cloud strategy

Let's discuss Thursday. Also, can you bring someone from your technical team to review our resource utilization?

Lisa and Robert,

Adding CFO perspective to this discussion:

BUDGET CONSTRAINTS:
- IT infrastructure budget for 2025: Flat vs 2024
- We cannot absorb a 29% increase without cutting other initiatives
- Maximum approved increase: 10% ($264,000/year)

STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:
- We value vendor consolidation (fewer vendors = easier management)
- However, price must be competitive
- We have board approval to evaluate alternatives if needed

DECISION TIMELINE:
- Need to finalize vendor selection by November 20
- Contract must be executed by December 15 for Jan 1 start
- This gives us limited time for evaluation and migration if we switch

Robert - We need your best and final offer by November 8. If we can't reach agreement, we'll need to accelerate evaluation of alternatives.

Michael Foster
CFO
