Amanda,

Engineering update:

BUGS STATUS:
✅ Bug #4521 (checkout timeout) - FIXED, deployed to staging
✅ Bug #4523 (payment validation) - FIXED, deployed to staging
⏰ Bug #4527 (mobile UI issue) - IN PROGRESS, fix ready tomorrow
⏰ Bug #4530 (API rate limiting) - IN PROGRESS, fix by Nov 16
⏰ Bug #4532 (error messaging) - MINOR, can go live as-is

LOAD TESTING:
- Scheduled for Friday, Nov 16 at 10:00 AM
- Test environment scaled up to production specs
- Test script simulates Black Friday traffic patterns
- Target: 10,000 concurrent users, < 2 second response time

PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT:
- Planned for Monday, Nov 18 (evening, off-hours)
- Deployment window: 8:00 PM - 11:00 PM
- Rollback plan tested and ready

CONCERNS:
Bug #4530 (API rate limiting) is taking longer than expected. If not fixed by Nov 16, we may need to:
- Option A: Launch with reduced rate limits (could impact user experience)
- Option B: Delay launch by 1 week to Dec 8

I'll have a better assessment after tomorrow's code review.

Sales enablement update:

COMPLETED ✅:
- Demo environment with 5 sample customer accounts

- Objection handling guide (draft in review)

SALES TEAM FEEDBACK:
Team is excited about the launch! Key questions from sales:
1. What's the pricing for enterprise customers? (>500 seats)
2. Do we offer trials or only paid plans?
3. What's the implementation timeline customers should expect?

Amanda - can you clarify these for the sales training session?

PIPELINE UPDATE:
- 47 qualified leads interested in the new product
- 12 deals pending launch (waiting to see the product)

Customer Success update:

COMPLETED ✅:
- Onboarding checklist (5-step process for new customers)
- Email templates for onboarding communication
- Support team training scheduled: Nov 17, 10:00-12:00 PM
- Escalation procedures documented

IN PROGRESS ⏰:
- Help center articles: 8 of 10 complete (2 in draft)
- Product walkthrough videos: 3 of 5 complete
- Internal FAQ for support team (draft ready for review)

CONCERN 🚨:
We need at least 48 hours post-launch before support team will be fully confident. I recommend:
- "Soft launch" on Dec 1 (limited announcement)
- Support team shadows product team Dec 1-2
- "Full launch" marketing push on Dec 3

This gives support team real-world experience before high volume inquiries.

Thoughts?
