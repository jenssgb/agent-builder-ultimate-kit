SUMMARY:
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security
to your company account.

ARTICLE CONTENT:

## What is MFA?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requires two forms of verification:
1. **Something you know** (password)
2. **Something you have** (phone, security key)

This prevents unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.

## Why Enable MFA?

✓ **Required for certain roles** (IT, Finance, HR, Executives)
✓ **Protects sensitive data** (company & customer information)
✓ **Prevents account takeovers** (most common security breach)
✓ **Required for remote access** (VPN, internal systems)
✓ **Company security policy** (all employees by Q2 2024)

## MFA Methods

Choose one of these methods:

### 1. Mobile Authenticator App (Recommended)

**Best for:** Everyone with smartphone
**Apps:**
- Microsoft Authenticator (recommended)

- Authy

**Pros:**
✓ Works offline

### 2. SMS Text Message

**Best for:** Users without smartphone or prefer texts
**Pros:**

**Cons:**

⚠️ Requires cell signal

### 3. Phone Call

**Best for:** Users with phone but no smartphone
**Pros:**
✓ Works on any phone
✓ Automated voice call

### 4. Hardware Security Key (Advanced)

✓ Most secure option
✓ Phishing-resistant

**Cons:**
⚠️ Costs money ($25-50)
⚠️ Can be lost (order backup)

## Software Renewal Requests

For existing software expiring:

## Denied Requests - Common Reasons

Software may be denied due to:

## Timeline Expectations
