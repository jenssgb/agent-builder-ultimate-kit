shows CompanyWiFi with signal strength "100%" but authentication says
"WPA2-Enterprise."

[January 14, 2024 11:30 AM - David Martinez]
Issue identified. Your network profile is corrupted. Solution:
1. Forget the WiFi network (Settings > Network > WiFi > Manage known networks)
2. Restart laptop
3. Reconnect to CompanyWiFi
4. Use credentials: username@company.com / your password
Certificate should auto-install

Waiting for user to try solution.

[January 14, 2024 02:00 PM - Jennifer Adams]
Tried the steps. When I click "Forget" it says "Can't forget this network."
Error message: "This network is managed by your organization."

[January 14, 2024 02:30 PM - David Martinez]
Escalating to Tier 2. This requires GPO policy reset. @Alex Kim can you
take a look?

Status: Resolved
Category: Software > Email
Subcategory: Mobile Email Access

Created: January 15, 2024 08:00 AM
Resolved: January 15, 2024 09:45 AM
Assigned To: Lisa Thompson (Email Support)
Reported By: Robert Kim (Sales)
Location: Remote (Chicago, IL)

DESCRIPTION:
Cannot access company email on my iPhone. Outlook app keeps asking for
password but when I enter it, it says "Cannot verify account credentials."
Password works fine on my laptop. This is urgent as I'm traveling and need
email access for client meetings today.

Device: iPhone 14 Pro
iOS Version: 17.2
Outlook App Version: 4.2349.0
Employee ID: EMP2234

BUSINESS IMPACT: HIGH
- Missing client emails
- Have important meeting at 11am
- Cannot access calendar/contacts

WORK NOTES:

[January 15, 2024 08:10 AM - Lisa Thompson]
Acknowledged. Checking account status in Exchange Admin Center.
Account status: Active
Last sync: January 14, 2024 11:45 PM
No locks or restrictions on account.

Troubleshooting steps sent to user:
1. Remove email account from Outlook app
2. Clear Outlook app cache (Settings > Outlook > Clear Cache)
3. Reinstall Outlook app from App Store
4. Re-add account using full email + password

[January 15, 2024 08:30 AM - Robert Kim]
Tried steps 1-3. When re-adding account, after entering email, it shows
"Authenticating..." then "Additional authentication required" with a link.
Link takes me to Microsoft sign-in page.

[January 15, 2024 08:45 AM - Lisa Thompson]
Good! This is expected. MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) was enabled on
your account on January 13th as part of company-wide security rollout.

Next steps:
1. Complete the sign-in on Microsoft page
2. Approve MFA request (check for push notification on your phone)
3. Or enter 6-digit code from authenticator app
4. Check "Don't ask again for 90 days"

MFA is now required for all mobile email access. See KB0001300 for MFA setup.

[January 15, 2024 09:00 AM - Robert Kim]
Ah! I see. I never set up MFA. How do I do that?

[January 15, 2024 09:15 AM - Lisa Thompson]
Sending you direct setup link: https://aka.ms/mfasetup

Short version:
1. Go to link above from your laptop
2. Download Microsoft Authenticator app on your iPhone
3. Follow prompts to scan QR code
4. Return to Outlook app on phone and retry login
5. Approve the MFA push notification

This will take about 5 minutes. Let me know if any issues.

[January 15, 2024 09:30 AM - Robert Kim]
Perfect! MFA setup complete. Outlook now syncing emails. I'm back in
business. Thank you!

[January 15, 2024 09:45 AM - Lisa Thompson]
Excellent! Glad it's working. For future reference, you can manage MFA
settings at https://account.company.com/security

Closing ticket as resolved.

RESOLUTION:
User needed to set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) which was recently
made mandatory for mobile email access. Guided user through MFA setup using
Microsoft Authenticator app. Email access restored.

ROOT CAUSE:
Company-wide MFA rollout completed January 13, 2024. Users with mobile
email access require MFA configuration. User had not yet configured MFA.

RESOLUTION TIME: 1 hour 45 minutes
USER SATISFACTION: 5/5 stars
Comments: "Fast response and clear instructions. Thank you!"

2 days. File transfers taking 10x longer than normal. Video calls dropping
frequently. Downloads timing out.

REPORTED SYMPTOMS:
- Normal speed: 50-100 Mbps
- Current speed: 2-5 Mbps
- High latency (500-1000ms ping)
- Frequent disconnections
- Unable to access file shares

AFFECTED USERS: ~150 users (estimated)
BUSINESS IMPACT: Productivity significantly degraded for remote workers

WORK NOTES:

[January 12, 2024 03:00 PM - Network Operations Center]
Incident declared. Severity escalated to Major Incident.
- Created war room channel: #incident-vpn-slow
- Engaged network engineering team
- Began investigation

Initial checks:
- VPN gateway CPU: 45% (normal)
- VPN gateway memory: 60% (normal)
- Active VPN connections: 487 (normal range)
- Internet bandwidth: 2.5 Gbps / 10 Gbps capacity (within normal)

[January 12, 2024 04:15 PM - Jake Morrison, Network Engineer]
Found potential issue:
- VPN tunnel to NYC datacenter showing packet loss (15-20%)
- Latency increased from 20ms baseline to 500-800ms
- Suspect ISP routing issue

Actions taken:
- Contacted ISP (Tier 1 support, ticket #999123)
- Running continuous ping tests
- Monitoring tunnel health

[January 12, 2024 06:30 PM - ISP Support]
ISP confirms routing issue on their backbone network.
- Fiber cut in Pennsylvania affecting East Coast routes
- Traffic being rerouted through Chicago (longer path = higher latency)
- ETA for fiber repair: 12-18 hours

[January 12, 2024 07:00 PM - Jake Morrison]
Interim solution implemented:
- Configured secondary VPN tunnel through Dallas datacenter
- Updated DNS to direct East Coast users to Dallas tunnel
- West Coast users remain on existing tunnel (unaffected)

Expected improvement: 50-70% (not back to normal, but much better)

[January 12, 2024 08:30 PM - Network Operations Center]
Monitoring results after tunnel switchover:
- Average latency: 150ms (improved from 600ms)
- Speed tests: 15-25 Mbps (improved from 2-5 Mbps)
- User reports: Noticeably better but still not normal
- Acceptable interim state while ISP repairs fiber

Status: Incident severity lowered from Major to Minor
Continuing to monitor. Will restore primary tunnel when ISP completes repair.

[January 13, 2024 10:15 AM - Jake Morrison]
PRIMARY TUNNEL RESTORED
- ISP completed fiber repair at 9:30 AM
- Primary NYC tunnel back online
- Latency: 22ms (back to baseline)
- Speed tests: 80-100 Mbps (normal range)
- Packet loss: 0% (normal)

Actions taken:
- Switched users back to primary NYC tunnel
- Validated performance with test users
- Monitoring for 1 hour to ensure stability

[January 13, 2024 11:00 AM - Network Operations Center]
All metrics normal for past hour. No user reports of issues.

INCIDENT RESOLVED

ROOT CAUSE:
ISP fiber cut in Pennsylvania caused routing issues, resulting in high
latency and packet loss for VPN tunnel to NYC datacenter.

RESOLUTION:
- Temporary: Switched users to secondary VPN tunnel via Dallas
- Permanent: Primary tunnel restored after ISP repaired fiber cut
