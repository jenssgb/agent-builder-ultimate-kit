[2:00 PM] Sarah Johnson:
Good afternoon everyone. Let's get started with Sprint 12 planning. Michael, can you walk us through the priorities for this sprint?

[2:02 PM] Michael Chen:
Thanks Sarah. For Sprint 12, our top priority is the OAuth 2.0 authentication enhancement. We have three high-priority user stories:
- User Story 1234: Implement OAuth flow for third-party integrations
- User Story 1245: Add token refresh mechanism
- User Story 1250: Update authentication documentation

The OAuth work is critical for our Q4 enterprise customer commitments. We also have some technical debt from Sprint 11 that we need to address.

[2:05 PM] Jennifer Lee:
Thanks Michael. I've reviewed these stories with the team. For User Story 1234, we'll need to break it down into several tasks. I'm estimating about 13 story points for the OAuth implementation alone.

[2:07 PM] David Kim:
I can take the lead on the OAuth implementation. I've done similar work with Azure AD integration before. However, we'll need to coordinate with the security team for the token storage approach.

[2:10 PM] Michael Chen:
Good point David. I've already scheduled a sync with the security team for Monday. They'll provide guidance on secure token storage and key rotation policies.

[2:12 PM] Emily Rodriguez:
From a QA perspective, we'll need comprehensive test scenarios for the OAuth flow. I'm concerned about edge cases - what happens when tokens expire during an active session? What about network interruptions during the authentication handshake?

[2:15 PM] Jennifer Lee:
Excellent questions Emily. Let's create a separate task for defining test scenarios. I'd like you and David to collaborate on that.

[2:18 PM] Sarah Johnson:
Let me capture the action items so far:
- ACTION: David to lead OAuth 2.0 implementation (Story 1234)
- ACTION: Michael to sync with security team on Monday
- ACTION: Emily and David to define comprehensive test scenarios
- DUE DATE: Test scenarios by Wednesday EOD

[2:20 PM] Michael Chen:
For User Story 1245, the token refresh mechanism, this is a dependency on 1234. We can't start this until the base OAuth flow is complete and tested.

[2:22 PM] David Kim:
Agreed. I propose we schedule 1245 for the second week of the sprint, assuming 1234 passes QA by end of week 1.

[2:25 PM] Jennifer Lee:
That works. Let's talk about capacity. David, you're at 80% this sprint due to the conference next week, correct?

[2:27 PM] David Kim:
Yes, I'll be at the DevOps Summit Tuesday through Thursday next week. I can do some work remotely in the evenings, but I'm planning for reduced capacity.

[2:30 PM] Sarah Johnson:
Noted. Let's plan accordingly. Jennifer, can we assign some of the OAuth tasks to other team members?

[2:32 PM] Jennifer Lee:
Yes, I'll pair Maria with David on this. She can handle the UI components while David focuses on the backend authentication logic.

[2:35 PM] Michael Chen:
What about the technical debt from Sprint 11? The database connection pooling issue is causing intermittent timeouts in production.

[2:37 PM] Jennifer Lee:
That's Bug 1240. We've identified the root cause - connection pool isn't being released properly in the error handling path. I've assigned this to Tom. It should be a quick fix, maybe 3 story points.

[2:40 PM] Emily Rodriguez:
I'd like to add regression testing for that bug fix. We've had issues with connection pooling before, and I want to ensure this doesn't break anything else.

[2:42 PM] Sarah Johnson:
Good call. Emily, can you create a task for regression testing under Bug 1240?

[2:43 PM] Emily Rodriguez:
Will do.

[2:45 PM] Michael Chen:
One more thing - we have User Story 1250 for updating the authentication documentation. This is lower priority but important for our developer portal.

[2:48 PM] Jennifer Lee:
I can take that one. It's mostly writing and screenshots, about 5 story points. I'll coordinate with Technical Writing team.

[2:50 PM] Sarah Johnson:
Perfect. Let me summarize our commitments for Sprint 12:
- User Story 1234: OAuth 2.0 implementation (13 points) - David (lead) and Maria
- Bug 1240: Fix connection pooling (3 points) - Tom
- User Story 1245: Token refresh (8 points) - David and Maria (week 2)
- User Story 1250: Update docs (5 points) - Jennifer
- Total: 29 story points

Our velocity last sprint was 27 points, so this is slightly ambitious. Any concerns?

[2:52 PM] Jennifer Lee:
I think we can handle it if everything goes smoothly. The risk is if we hit blockers on the OAuth work.

[2:54 PM] Michael Chen:
Agreed. Let's have a checkpoint on Wednesday to assess progress. If we're behind, we can descope the documentation story.

[2:56 PM] David Kim:
One more thing - do we have the test accounts set up for OAuth testing? I'll need accounts with various permission levels.

[2:58 PM] Emily Rodriguez:
Good catch. I'll work with IT to get test accounts created. I'll need that by Monday.

[3:00 PM] Sarah Johnson:
ACTION: Emily to coordinate test account setup with IT by Monday.

[3:02 PM] Michael Chen:
I have one more story that came up yesterday - User Story 1260 about adding multi-factor authentication support. Can we fit this in?

[3:04 PM] Jennifer Lee:
That's 8 points minimum. We're already at capacity. I'd recommend we add it to the backlog for Sprint 13 unless it's absolutely critical.

[3:06 PM] Michael Chen:
Fair enough. Let's target Sprint 13. I'll update the roadmap.

[3:10 PM] Sarah Johnson:
Great. Let's talk about risks. What could derail this sprint?

[3:12 PM] David Kim:
Main risk is the OAuth integration being more complex than estimated. If we hit unexpected API limitations or security requirements, that could add time.

[3:14 PM] Emily Rodriguez:
QA risk is inadequate test coverage for edge cases. We need to be thorough because authentication failures in production would be critical.

[3:16 PM] Michael Chen:
Business risk is missing our Q4 customer commitment. The enterprise clients are expecting OAuth support by end of November.

[3:18 PM] Sarah Johnson:
Let's plan mitigation strategies:
- Daily standups will focus on OAuth progress
- We'll have a mid-sprint checkpoint on Wednesday
- If we're behind, we'll pull in additional resources
- Emily will prioritize critical path testing

[3:22 PM] Jennifer Lee:
Sounds good. I'll update Jira with all the tasks and assignments today.

[3:24 PM] Sarah Johnson:
Perfect. Before we wrap, any other concerns or questions?

[3:26 PM] David Kim:
None from me. Clear on the plan.

[3:27 PM] Emily Rodriguez:
All set.

[3:28 PM] Michael Chen:
Good planning session everyone. Let's make Sprint 12 a success!

[3:30 PM] Sarah Johnson:
Thanks everyone. Meeting adjourned. Sprint 12 officially starts Monday!
