[Nov 1, 9:15 AM] Sarah Johnson:
Good morning team! 👋 Kicking off November with Sprint 11 officially complete. Great work everyone on hitting our velocity target. Sprint 12 planning is scheduled for Nov 15th.

[Nov 1, 9:22 AM] David Kim:
Thanks Sarah! Quick question - are we still targeting the OAuth feature for Sprint 12? I saw it moved up in priority on the roadmap.

[Nov 1, 9:25 AM] Michael Chen:
Yes, OAuth is definitely Sprint 12. Enterprise customers are asking for it, and it's blocking two enterprise deals. High priority.

[Nov 1, 10:30 AM] Emily Rodriguez:
@David Kim - I found a regression bug in the login flow from yesterday's deployment. Bug #1240. Users are getting intermittent timeouts. Can you take a look?

[Nov 1, 10:45 AM] David Kim:
Looking at it now. Seems to be related to database connection pooling. I'll create a fix.

[Nov 1, 11:20 AM] David Kim:
Root cause identified. Connection pool isn't being released properly in the error handling path. Fix is straightforward. I'll have a PR up this afternoon.

[Nov 1, 2:30 PM] Tom Wilson:
@David Kim - I can take the connection pooling fix if you want to focus on OAuth prep. I've worked on that code before.

[Nov 1, 2:35 PM] David Kim:
That would be great Tom. I'll assign Bug 1240 to you and add my findings to the ticket.

[Nov 4, 8:00 AM] Jennifer Lee:
Team - heads up that I'll be reviewing the architecture docs today for the payment processing system. Architecture review meeting is scheduled for Nov 12.

[Nov 4, 9:15 AM] Lisa Park:
@Jennifer Lee - I've uploaded the database schema design to the project wiki. Let me know if you have questions.

[Nov 4, 10:00 AM] Jennifer Lee:
Thanks Lisa! Quick question - what's the rationale for monthly partitioning vs quarterly?

[Nov 4, 10:15 AM] Lisa Park:
Monthly gives us more granular archive control. We can move old partitions to cold storage without impacting recent data queries. Performance is also better with smaller partitions.

[Nov 5, 11:00 AM] Michael Chen:
FYI - just got off a call with the enterprise client (Acme Corp). They're asking about timeline for OAuth integration. I told them end of November. Can we commit to that?

[Nov 5, 11:10 AM] Sarah Johnson:
Michael, let's discuss in our 1:1 today. November is tight but potentially doable if OAuth is the only Sprint 12 priority.

[Nov 5, 11:15 AM] Jennifer Lee:
We'll need to keep scope tight. If we hit any blockers, November could be at risk. December 1st would be safer.

[Nov 5, 11:20 AM] Michael Chen:
Understood. Let me check if December 1st works for the client.

[Nov 6, 3:30 PM] Emily Rodriguez:
Quick win! 🎉 All regression tests passing after Tom's connection pooling fix. Ready to deploy to production.

[Nov 6, 3:35 PM] Sarah Johnson:
Excellent! Tom, can you deploy today?

[Nov 6, 3:40 PM] Tom Wilson:
Deploying now. Should be live in 10 minutes.

[Nov 6, 4:00 PM] Tom Wilson:
Deployment complete. Monitoring dashboards show connection pool metrics back to normal.

[Nov 7, 9:00 AM] David Kim:
Quick heads up - I'll be at DevOps Summit Nov 19-21. I'll have limited availability those days but can work evenings if needed.

[Nov 7, 9:10 AM] Sarah Johnson:
Thanks for the heads up David. We'll plan Sprint 12 tasks accordingly.

---

[Nov 8, 2:00 PM] Alex Thompson:
@Jennifer Lee - I've set up the security scanning tools for the payment system. Documentation is in the wiki. Let me know when you want to do the walkthrough.

[Nov 8, 2:15 PM] Jennifer Lee:
Thanks Alex! Can we schedule for Monday Nov 11? I want the team to see the setup.

[Nov 8, 2:20 PM] Alex Thompson:
Monday works. I'll send a calendar invite.

[Nov 11, 10:30 AM] Maria Garcia:
Question for the team - has anyone worked with OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow before? I'm doing research for Sprint 12.

[Nov 11, 10:45 AM] David Kim:
I have! I implemented it for the Azure AD integration last year. Happy to pair with you on this Maria.

[Nov 11, 11:00 AM] Maria Garcia:
That would be awesome! Can we schedule 30 min tomorrow?

[Nov 11, 11:05 AM] David Kim:
Sure, how about 2pm tomorrow?

[Nov 11, 11:10 AM] Maria Garcia:
Perfect! 👍

[Nov 12, 1:45 PM] Robert Martinez:
Architecture review starts in 15 minutes. Join link: [meeting link]

[Nov 12, 1:50 PM] Jennifer Lee:
On my way 🏃‍♀️

[Nov 13, 9:00 AM] Emily Rodriguez:
Team - I need to request test accounts from IT for OAuth testing. What permission levels do we need to test?

[Nov 13, 9:15 AM] David Kim:
We'll need:
- Basic user (read-only)
- Power user (read-write)
- Admin (full access)
- Disabled user (for negative testing)

[Nov 13, 9:20 AM] Emily Rodriguez:
Got it. I'll submit the IT ticket today. They usually take 2-3 days.

[Nov 14, 11:00 AM] Sarah Johnson:
Reminder: Sprint 12 planning tomorrow at 2pm. Please review the backlog before the meeting. Top candidate stories:
- US-1234: OAuth 2.0 implementation
- US-1245: Token refresh mechanism
- US-1250: Update auth documentation
- Bug-1240: Connection pooling (already in progress)

[Nov 14, 11:15 AM] Michael Chen:
I'll present priorities and business context at the start of the meeting.

[Nov 14, 2:00 PM] Tom Wilson:
Quick update - Bug 1240 has been in production for a week with zero issues. I'm closing the ticket.

[Nov 14, 2:05 PM] Emily Rodriguez:
Confirmed. All monitoring metrics are green. ✅

---

[Nov 15, 8:30 AM] David Kim:
Looking forward to Sprint Planning this afternoon! I've done my homework on OAuth - reviewed Stripe and PayPal's implementations. We have good examples to follow.

[Nov 15, 8:45 AM] Jennifer Lee:
Great prep David! I've also drafted the task breakdown for US-1234. We can refine it during planning.

[Nov 15, 9:00 AM] Sarah Johnson:
Love the proactive prep team! See everyone at 2pm.
