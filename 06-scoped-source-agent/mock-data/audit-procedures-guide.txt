INTERNAL AUDIT PROCEDURES AND METHODOLOGY
Audit Department | Version 4.0 | Effective: January 1, 2024

=============================================================================
DOCUMENT OVERVIEW
=============================================================================

PURPOSE:
This document establishes standardized audit procedures and methodologies
for the Internal Audit Department to ensure consistent, thorough, and
compliant audits across all organizational functions.

SCOPE:
Applies to all internal audits including:
- Financial audits
- IT/cybersecurity audits
- Operational audits
- Compliance audits
- Special investigations

AUDIT AUTHORITY:
Internal Audit has unrestricted access to:
✓ All records, data, and information systems
✓ All personnel and facilities
✓ All third-party agreements and contracts
✓ Board and management meetings (as observer)

INDEPENDENCE:
Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee (Board of Directors)
Administratively reports to CEO for day-to-day operations

=============================================================================
SECTION 1: AUDIT PLANNING
=============================================================================

1.1 ANNUAL AUDIT PLAN

RISK-BASED APPROACH:
Annual audit plan based on risk assessment including:
- Enterprise risk register review
- Prior audit findings
- Regulatory requirements (SOX 404, GDPR, etc.)
- Management requests
- Industry trends and emerging risks

PLAN COMPONENTS:
✓ Audit universe (all auditable entities)
✓ Risk ratings (High, Medium, Low)
✓ Audit frequency (Annual, Biennial, Triennial)
✓ Estimated hours per audit
✓ Resource allocation
✓ Timeline and milestones

APPROVAL PROCESS:
1. Chief Audit Executive (CAE) develops plan (November)
2. Management review and input (December)
3. Audit Committee approval (January)
4. Plan updates mid-year if significant changes

1.2 INDIVIDUAL AUDIT PLANNING

PRE-AUDIT ACTIVITIES:
Week 1-2 before fieldwork:
✓ Review prior audit reports and findings
✓ Conduct preliminary risk assessment
✓ Identify key controls to test
✓ Develop audit program (test procedures)
✓ Request documentation from auditee
✓ Schedule entrance conference

RISK ASSESSMENT:
Evaluate inherent risk factors:
- Financial materiality ($$ impact)
- Complexity (processes, systems, regulations)
- Volatility (rate of change)
- Quality of management
- Prior audit results
- Control environment maturity

Assess residual risk after controls:
Residual Risk = Inherent Risk - Control Effectiveness

AUDIT PROGRAM:
Document specific procedures including:
- Control to be tested
- Test procedure (inspection, inquiry, observation, reperformance)
- Sample size and selection methodology
- Expected evidence
- Assigned auditor
- Due date

=============================================================================
SECTION 2: FIELDWORK EXECUTION
=============================================================================

2.1 ENTRANCE CONFERENCE

ATTENDEES:
- Audit team lead
- All audit team members
- Auditee management
- Process owners
- IT representatives (for system audits)

AGENDA:

✓ Communication protocol
✓ Workspace and access needs
✓ Q&A

DOCUMENTATION:
- Entrance conference memo
- Attendee list

2.2 CONTROL TESTING

SAMPLING METHODOLOGY:

Judgmental Sampling:
- Auditor selects items based on professional judgment
- Used for targeted testing (high-risk transactions, unusual items)

Random Sampling:
- Each item has equal probability of selection
- Used for representative sample

Stratified Sampling:
- Population divided into subgroups (strata)
- Random sample from each stratum
- Used when population has distinct subgroups

Monetary Unit Sampling (MUS):
- Dollar-weighted selection (larger $$ items more likely selected)
- Used for financial audits

SAMPLE SIZE GUIDELINES:

Population Size | Low Risk | Medium Risk | High Risk
< 50 items      | 5-10     | 10-15       | 15-25
50-250 items    | 15-25    | 25-40       | 40-60
251-500 items   | 25-40    | 40-60       | 60-80
> 500 items     | 40-60    | 60-80       | 80-100

CONTROL TESTING PROCEDURES:

Inspection:
- Examine documents, records, reports
- Look for: approvals, signatures, dates, accuracy

Observation:
- Watch process being performed in real-time
- Note: Only proves control worked at time of observation

Inquiry:
- Ask questions of process owners
- Document responses
- Note: Weakest form of evidence, requires corroboration

Reperformance:
- Execute control independently
- Compare results to auditee's results
- Strongest form of evidence
