EMPLOYEE CODE OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS
Human Resources Department | Version 5.0 | Effective: January 1, 2024

=============================================================================
INTRODUCTION
=============================================================================

MESSAGE FROM THE CEO:

At our company, we are committed to conducting business with the highest
standards of integrity, honesty, and ethical behavior. This Code of Conduct
defines the expectations for all employees, contractors, officers, and board
members.

Our reputation is built on trust - with customers, partners, employees, and
communities. Each of us has a responsibility to uphold these standards every
day. When facing ethical dilemmas, ask yourself:

- Is it legal?
- Is it consistent with our values?
- Would I be comfortable if this appeared in the news?
- Would I want my family to know I did this?

If the answer to any of these is "no," stop and seek guidance.

Thank you for your commitment to doing the right thing, always.

Signed,
[CEO Name]
Chief Executive Officer
