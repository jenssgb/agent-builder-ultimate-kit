Mike Johnson - Jan 10, 2024:
"We need this for the Q1 security review. Priority 1. Target completion
by end of Sprint 23."

Sarah Chen - Jan 11, 2024:
"Starting work. Will use `oauth2-proxy` library. Plan to support Azure AD
first, then Google. Est. 8 story points."

WORK ITEM #1250: Database Performance Optimization
=============================================================================

Type: Task
State: Active
Assigned To: Tom Anderson
Created By: Sarah Chen
Created Date: January 8, 2024
Modified Date: January 15, 2024
Priority: 2
Story Points: 8
Sprint: Sprint 23
Area Path: Project Alpha\Backend\Database
Iteration Path: 2024\Q1\Sprint 23

DESCRIPTION:
Dashboard queries are taking 5-10 seconds. Need to optimize database
indexes and queries to reduce load time to under 1 second.

TASKS:
- [ ] Analyze slow query logs
- [ ] Identify missing indexes
- [ ] Optimize N+1 query patterns
- [ ] Implement query caching where appropriate
- [ ] Add database monitoring alerts
- [ ] Document optimization changes

CURRENT STATUS:
- Completed slow query analysis
- Identified 15 missing indexes
- Created 8 indexes so far (50% complete)
- Query time reduced from 8s to 3s (in progress)

DISCUSSION (6 comments):

Tom Anderson - Jan 8, 2024:
"Starting analysis. Will review slow query logs from past 7 days."

Tom Anderson - Jan 10, 2024:
"Analysis complete. Found several issues:
1. Missing indexes on user_activity table (queries scanning 2M rows)
2. N+1 queries in dashboard API (100+ queries per page load)
3. No caching on frequently accessed data

Starting with indexes first."

Sarah Chen - Jan 11, 2024:
"Great analysis! For the N+1 queries, can you use eager loading? We've
seen good results with that pattern elsewhere."

Tom Anderson - Jan 11, 2024:
"Yes, switching to eager loading for relationships. Also adding Redis
caching for user metadata (changes infrequently)."

Mike Johnson - Jan 13, 2024:
"How's progress? Do we need more time or can we hit Sprint 23 goal?"

Tom Anderson - Jan 15, 2024:
"On track. 8/15 indexes deployed. Query time down to 3s. Expect to hit
<1s target by end of sprint."

WORK ITEM #1270: BUG - Mobile App Crashes on iOS 17
=============================================================================

Type: Bug
State: Active
Assigned To: Emily Rodriguez
Created By: Customer Support (Jessica Lee)
Created Date: January 12, 2024
Modified Date: January 14, 2024
Priority: 1 (Critical)
Severity: High
Sprint: Sprint 23
Area Path: Project Alpha\Mobile\iOS
Iteration Path: 2024\Q1\Sprint 23

DESCRIPTION:
Multiple users reporting app crashes when opening notifications on iOS 17.
Crash occurs immediately upon tapping notification. No crash logs available
from users yet.

REPRO STEPS:
1. Receive push notification
2. Tap notification to open app
3. App crashes immediately
4. Happens 100% of the time on iOS 17, does not occur on iOS 16

IMPACT:
- Affecting ~30% of iOS users (iOS 17 adoption rate)
- 47 support tickets filed in past 2 days
- App Store rating dropped from 4.5 to 3.8
- High priority to fix

ENVIRONMENT:
- iOS: 17.0, 17.1, 17.2 (all versions affected)
- App Version: 2.4.0
- Device: iPhone 12, 13, 14, 15 (all models)

DISCUSSION (5 comments):

Jessica Lee (Support) - Jan 12, 2024:
"URGENT: Receiving many crash reports from iOS users. Escalating to
development team. Attached 10 user reports."

Emily Rodriguez - Jan 12, 2024:
"Investigating. Attempting to reproduce locally. Need crash logs from
TestFlight or App Store Connect."

Emily Rodriguez - Jan 13, 2024:
"FOUND THE ISSUE: iOS 17 changed notification handling API. Our code
assumes old behavior causing null pointer exception. Fix in progress."

Emily Rodriguez - Jan 14, 2024:
"Fix implemented and tested on iOS 17. Submitting build 2.4.1 to App Store
for review today. ETA: 24-48 hours for approval."

Mike Johnson - Jan 14, 2024:
"Great work Emily! Jessica - please prepare communication for affected
users. Let them know fix is coming in v2.4.1."
